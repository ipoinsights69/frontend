    "IPOHut was founded in 2023 by a team of financial analysts and technology experts who recognized a gap in the market for comprehensive, user-friendly IPO information in India.",
    "We noticed that while the Indian IPO market was booming, retail investors often struggled to find accurate, timely, and easy-to-understand information about upcoming IPOs, subscription status, and post-listing performance. Information was scattered across multiple sources, often presented in complex formats that were difficult for the average investor to interpret.",
    "Our founding team set out to solve this problem by creating a single, reliable platform that would democratize access to IPO information and empower retail investors to make informed decisions. Today, IPOHut has grown to become India's most trusted resource for IPO tracking and analysis, serving over 500,000 users monthly."
